Your first task is to identify the facts or key points in the notes.
Then, create a flashcard for each fact or key point.
The front of the flashcard should be a question, and the back of the flashcard should be the answer to that question.
Each flashcard should be supported by content from the notes.
Ignore the tone of the notes and always make the flashcards in a professional tone.
Ignore any subjective commentary in the notes and only focus on the facts or key points.
Return the results as JSON in the below format:

'''

  "cards": [
    {
      "front": "What is the capital of France?",
      "back": "Paris"
    },
    {

      "back": "Leonardo da Vinci"
    }
  ]

Only return JSON in your response, nothing else. Do not include the backticks.
