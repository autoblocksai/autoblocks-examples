<!-- getting started end -->

## Install dependencies

```

```

## Run the script

```
npm run start
```

## View the tracked prompts in Autoblocks

At https://app.autoblocks.ai/prompts, you should see an entry for each `autoblocks-tracker-id` in the example script:

```tsx
<ChatCompletion
  temperature={0}
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo"
  autoblocks-tracker-id="get-thing-color"
>
```

and:

```tsx
<ChatCompletion
  temperature={0}
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo"
  autoblocks-tracker-id="determine-color-combination"
>
```

Click on View History to view a tracking ID's history. At this point it should only have one version.

## View the traces in Autoblocks

Click on the search icon to the left of the View History button to view traces belonging to the given tracking ID.

Click on the trace to view the trace tree.

## Make a change to one of the prompts

Make a change to one of the system or user messages. For example, in the `GetThingColor` component, change this:

```tsx
<SystemMessage>
  You are a helpful assistant. Always respond with one word in all lowercase
  letters and no punctuation.
</SystemMessage>
```

To this:

```tsx
<SystemMessage>
  You are a helpful assistant. ALWAYS respond with one word in all lowercase
  letters and no punctuation.
</SystemMessage>
```

## Run the script

Run the script again:

```
npm run start
```

After running the script, you should see a new version at https://app.autoblocks.ai/prompts/get-thing-color
since one of the templates changed:

<img width="1467" alt="get-thing-color-v2" src="https://github.com/autoblocksai/autoblocks-examples/assets/7498009/655d651f-d4af-4473-893c-289b3723a9a4">

These automated versions are also attached to your traces as the property `promptTracking.version`, so you can use this property to create charts and tables to track the performance of your prompts over time.
