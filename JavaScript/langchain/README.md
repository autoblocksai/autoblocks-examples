## View the trace in Autoblocks

Go to the [explore page](https://app.autoblocks.ai/explore). When you find the trace, switch to the Trace Tree view to
see a tree of all the spans in the trace.

The first span that is selected will show you the overall question and answer of the LangChain pipeline, but you can also
